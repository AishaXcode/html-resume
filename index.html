             <h2>Summary</h2>
             <p>I am a 19-year-old aspiring developer who has learned HTML so far and is eager to expand my skills. Starting next month, I will be pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence (AI). To prepare myself  for the future, I have taken on multiple jobs to gain diverse experiences and build my skill set. I have found that programming is my true passion; I genuinely enjoy it and am excited to take on new challenges. I am actively looking for opportunities to learn more and apply my skills in real-world projects.
